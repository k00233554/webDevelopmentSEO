      <h2>Programme Aims for Creative Multi-Media Programming</h2>
     
      <p>This postgraduate programme offers rewarding and challenging possibilities for learners interested in undertaking a conversion programme in the area of multimedia, and its application in social, media and enterprise environments. Given the scale of the IT sector in Ireland, and the current expansion of roles associated with the IT sector, it is projected that there will be healthy demand for talented Computing/ IT graduates over the next number of years. The aim of this 1 year conversion programme is to provide students with an academically challenging educational experience that will enable them to develop the knowledge base, professional attitudes, project management skills and industry awareness to serve both the multimedia computing industry and society. The course also aims to provide the student with the opportunity to engage in independent research that integrates concepts, issues and ethical principles that allow the student to question existing precepts.</p>
